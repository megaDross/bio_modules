Design
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

get_seq()	
	|	determines whether or not the input is a STRING or a FILE.
	|	STRING: creates a list [name_var,\t,var_pos/genomic_region]
	|		and inputs it into get_seq_data()
	|	FILE: opens the file and it is parsed into get_seq_data(). the
	|	      returned list is iterated through so the contents can be
	|	      written to an output_file (ONLY works if --output_file is
	|	      utilised).
	V
get_seq_data()
 |    |  |	iterate through each line, split by the delimiter (name & genomic 
 |    |  |	pos/range) and parse into the functions contained within the 
 |    |  |	processing class (in order; 1,2,3). handle_argument_exceptions are
 |    |  |      handled here. create_region() is only utilised if a genomic position
 |3   |2 |1	is inputted instead of a genomic range. 
 |    |	 |
 |    |	 V
 |    |	handle_argument_exceptions()	
 |    |                                 each line is determined whether it contains 
 |    |					a WrongHGversion; a version of the human
 |    |					genome which is unsupported by UCSC, a 
 |    |					TypographyError; less/more than one colon
 |    |					&/or more than one comma or dash, ErrorUCSC;
 |    |					UCSC DAS server returns nothing, if so raise
 |    |					exception
 |    V
 |   create_region()	
 |                      construct a genomic range from a genomic position by subtracting
 |			and adding the integers associated with the upstream and the
 |			downstream variable respectively and place a comma between the
 |			two resulting integers i.e 1:123456 --> 1:123436,123476
 V
get_region_info()	
			use the hg_version and the created/inputted genomic range into 
			the UCSC DAS server link, filter the returned info for the 
			sequence only and determine whether to flank the genomic
			position with a dash (if --dash BOOLEAN is selected) and return
			to get_seq() and print to the screen.
